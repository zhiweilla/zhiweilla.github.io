Influenced by anime and sci-fi novels in my childhood, I always believe that I could 
do something special. But I forgot what it was.
Even though my academic result did not match my expectation at all in the first year,
and I was upset for a long time, I noticed that I might lose my direction.
For that, I spent a long time pondering what my real wish is.
And now, I remembered that I always hold a general wish: to change the world and make it better.
I know its sound very vague and even silly, but everything needs a start.
Contribute on my interest first, and then work step by step.
A good tomorrow is waiting for me.
